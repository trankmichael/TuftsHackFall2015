2,Hotel provided shuttle service to and from the airport and train station and provided a delicious hot breakfast which were both great money savers.  Having a suite allowed us to spread out and to have the close-by Market Basket steam lobsters to have dinner in our in- suite kitchen.  Boston hotels are pricy and this hotel was lower cost than most but provided first class facilities and service.  Certainly would return if another Boston trip arises.,"We've just spent a week at the Residence Inn in Chelsea and give it top marks as a practical, modern hotel offering good value. It's an ""all suites"" hotel, meaning the rooms are spacious with a living area and useful kitchenette (and excellent bathrooms too!) Ideal for an extended stay. Free parking, free buffet breakfast and free wifi. Excellent friendly service. Pleasant bar with some food available. There's an excellent Market Basket supermarket just 3 minutes walk away.

But we were disappointed there are no room safes. That's a surprising oversight by Marriott.

Downtown Boston hotels are stratospherically expensive so we chose to stay over the river in Chelsea, thus saving a couple of hundred dollars a night. We had checked on public transport options for going downtown and found these satisfactory. The hotel offers a complimentary shuttle to the nearest T stop (Boston underground). Alternatively it's a five minutes walk from the hotel to the bus stop, with #111 buses leaving every 10 minutes (c 15 minute trip to Haymarket station). We were happy to do that for the big savings in hotel rate!

On the other hand we have to admit the immediate neighborhood of the hotel was disappointing. Road and building construction sites in an industrial area with few local dining options beyond burgers and bars (but there is one Italian restaurant close by and a good, cheap and cheerful Thai place near Bellingham Square).","On the night of our arrival, we had planned dinner in the room only to have the stove top not work.  It was nearly 11pm before housekeeping was able to look at it and since no one from maintenance was available it went unfixed.  Then the next morning we awakened at 6am by the pounding of the massive construction site out the back of the hotel.  We had requested a ""quiet"" room since my husband wasn't flying in until the wee hours and we assured it was.  We only stayed at Marriott's on our 10 night family vacation and this one was the most disappointing, especially for the cost.  In addition,we barely received a sorry for the inconveniences.","Residence Inn has done a good job of meeting the needs of both business and leisure travelers. The decor is fresh and contemporary, and the suite concept allows room for spreading out. Be aware that walls and floors are thin. There was quite a bit of noise in the hallways, from people in the room above me, and also from shuttle buses outside. This is a pet friendly property, but I didn't appreciate the barking dog across the hall. Service is good, and everyone I came in contact with was professional, helpful, and friendly. Hot buffet breakfast is included, as is free parking.
I booked through hotels.com and saved $70 for one night. The hotel was unable to match pricing directly, so shopping around for price is worthwhile.","This hotel is great if you have a flight to take. We really enjoyed our suite and the amenities. Staff is welcoming and the room was very clean. The full breakfast was great. However, it is not well located if you want to go downtown. The main metro station on the Bue Line is closed for refurbishing and will reopen somewhere in 2016.  So it takes about 1 hour to go downtown with all the transfers!  We traveled with a young baby, so I would recommend for families with young children to stay downtown or in Cambridge instead. There is nothing to do nor to see around the hotel. There are works right beside the hotel and we had a view on the highway, but rooms are soundproofed. There is a good Italian restaurant (Floramo's) close to the hotel.",My friend and I stayed at the Residence in for one night just to get to the airport quickly in the am. Great hotel and staff especially the shuttle driver Mike. The hotel is very beautiful and clean. I would definitely stay here again if planning on being in Boston. Probably the nicest Residence in I have been at. They also offer free shuttle service to the airport or the train station so you can get downtown. ,"I stayed at this hotel pretty much every week for the last six months since I was working on  a project in Chelsea. This is a very good hotel for business travelers. They have a good free breakfast and decent free dinner on weeknights. The menu at the in-house restaurant/bar is limited. The rooms are pretty good sized and comfortable and clean. What I liked best about this hotel is the staff. Everyone, specially at front desk and the shuttle drivers was always very friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Kevin and Queneka at the front desk and the Richard the shuttle driver. Thanks for making my stay for the past few months very pleasant.","Stayed eight days on vacation.  One thing to note, there is major construction going on across the street and the workers (when weather permits) start very early.  Otherwise, Chris runs a very great establishment.  The Breakfast had a large selection and the food was always fresh.  They have free shuttle service that will take you to airport, the Blue Line at the Airport (MBTA.COM), the Cruise Lines or the local commuter rail.  

Did find the bar a bit expensive so we bought our own from a nearby liquor store.",Best hotel for being downtown! Staff always excellent!  Facility is always clean and love the design scheme! Kevin can always recommend a good local restaurant! Very close to everything in downtown.  Shuttle to and from Logan is the best! ,"This is a new, modern and clean hotel with friendly staff. It satisfied all my expectations for a hotel at this price point. It has a shuttle to Logan Airport (which we did not use). However, it is located in the middle of the Boston highway construction mess.  Our GPS guided us through an industrial zone with nothing but parked and idling 18-wheeler trucks and distribution centers because the interstate exit was closed. The roads there were full of potholes and it was an unsettling experience at night. You must request up to date instructions, including the road closures for that day, from the hotel.","I always like to stay close to the airport if I am visiting several places when I travel to a city.  Chelsea Residence is one of the newer properties. the decor is very hip. The staff is Marriott friendly...sincere and accommodating, willing to do anything to make your stay perfect.
The location is safe, enough for a single woman walking the area alone, close by eateries and the city proper. They even took me to the car rental return location so I could pick up and drop off a car, saving two days of rental car fees. you can tell the folks love their work.","Beautiful property, friendly staff, great breakfast, beautiful suite, conveniently located.  Was in Boston for a wedding with my wife and daughter.  Our spacious two-room suite was well suited.  My daughter slept on the hide-a-bed while my wife and I enjoyed the king-sized bed.  The bathroom was huge.","This hotel is a must. Super clean, fridge. 2 burner stove, microwave, coffee pot, everything needed for a great stay. The free breakfast was great. Eggs, meats, hot cereal. Waffles. Well beyond a pastry and coffee. Staff was very helpful. The shuttles took us to the T and to the airport, and the drivers were fun, almost mini- tour guides!","Hotel was very convenient to Logan Airport with easy shuttle service day and night and free on-site parking.  Typical residence inn breakfast and social hours, Decent bar, and very good rooms.  The wait staff was nice and attentive in person.  Don't bother calling them though, you will sit on hold.  I just walked to the lobby and asked them for what i needed.  I recommend the hotel for the business traveler.  One downside is that there really isn't any good restaurants around.","The room was clean, spacious, and almost luxurious. The bathroom was huge and well designed/appointed.
The bed was very comfortable, and the hotel staff was tremendously helpful.
They have a shuttle that is free to the airport and airport train station.",This hotel was a lot nicer than I expected.  The room (Jr. Suite) was very spacious.  The staff was very warm and helpful.  Kevin went above and beyond to make sure I had cabs and knew what my restaurant options were.,"We stayed here for 3 nights while visiting Boston.  While it took some planning to site see as it wasn't so close to town - the staff and service was fantastic.  The hotel shuttle with take you to the Train / T line / and car rentals in addition to having Airport shuttle.  
   The rooms are wonderful , clean and large with comfy beds and big kitchenettes.  They serve a nice spread for the free breakfast .
   All staff members are wonderful, pleasant and engaging.  The shuttle drivers. Reception, cleaning staff and waiters had smiles on their faces and were very nice.","I stayed here for 3 days for a conference scheduled in ""Boston"".  Let it be known, Chelsea is NOT Boston.  It's NEAR Boston, it is NOT Boston.  That is not the hotel's fault though.

I made the mistake of relying solely on my GPS to get me there. And in true GPS Fashion it took the least direct route possible.  Let's just say Chelsea is not the best neighborhood.  In fact, several times I found myself double checking to be sure the doors were locked and praying I didn't run out of gas.  It's a skeezy neighborhood.

The rooms are okay.  They have nice appliances and granite countertop.  The television was of good quality and swiveled so you could watch it from the bed or the living room.  The bed was not comfortable.  It was hard.  And the air conditioner was about 6 inches away from the bed.  I was either freezing or sweating.  There was no in between.  There is also a very large building being constructed next door that I later learned will be the FBI headquarters (another indication that you're not in the finest of neighborhoods).  The construction started at 6:00 on the nose.   The view from my window was of dumpsters.  Not that I was expecting a great view, but it literally was of a dumpster. 

I was also a little unnerved when I realized someone had been in my room while I was not there.  I'd put the card on the door saying I did not need housekeeping, but when I returned later in the day I noticed the toilet seat and lid were up.  Everything was exactly how I left it, except the toilet seat.  When I brought it to the front desk's attention I was told there was no record of anyone entering the room. I asked for another room, but they were unable to accomodate me because they were sold out.

The continental breakfast was okay, but not great.  Heavy on starches.  Greasy meats.  Fresh fruits, but only one kind per day.

The pool was great.  The gym was great.  The staff was very nice.  

I wouldn't choose to stay here, but if another conference is scheduled in Chelsea at this hotel, I would go back.","We booked here because I wanted to spend < 200 a night and that was a challenge in a city like Boston.  The rooms were awesome, large, comfortable, clean, modern.  The hotel was quiet, the location is fine if you have a car or you can use their shuttle to connect to the blue line.  They were very accommodating of some special requests we had and we are truly grateful.","We recently went to Boston and choose to stay at the Residence Inn in Chelsea. It is a hidden gem and we totally agree with all the reviews.  Best piece of advice, you must have a GPS to find this hotel.  It is in a transitioning neighbourhood.  The daily breakfast changes each and everyday. It is great!  The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  If you have a car, this is fine for local transit is not readily available."
