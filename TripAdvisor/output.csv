"We were coming up to the area for our local ski mountain's swap and were headed up to Vermont the next day so wanted to stay overnight.  Its leap peeping season and every place is ridiculously overpriced.  This was the only place that was affordable.  At first glance its decent but where I would say it falters is cleanliness.  There were black fuzzies all over the bed sheets, there was a used wash cloth hanging over the top of the shower and the shower curtain was moldy so likely not washed in a while.  Continental breakfast was very minimal, cold coffee in the percolator and just OJ and corn flakes.  The bed was also saggy on the right side but thankfully it was a king bed so there was plenty of room to lay down.  We were planning to evaluate it as a future place to stay when we come to the berkshires to ski but I don't think so after this.  It was good in a pinch but I don't think we'd stay here again.  "
"We were in Western Mass for a wedding and needed an affordable place to crash for one night. The Pleasant Valley Motel was just what we were looking for. Cozy, convenient, and a great value located in a small little town with really nice people."
"Older motel, nicely landscaped.  Fine for those seeking basic accommodation and value for money.  Stayed two week-end nights in early Oct.  Cost under $45 per night for room with 2 queen beds, large round table and 2 comfortable chairs, with microwave and refrigerator and flat-screen TV (none of which we used).  Excellent wifi.

Price includes minimal breakfast of dry cereal, juice and coffee, available at tables on porch at office entrance (or take to your room).  If that doesn't appeal we recommend No. 6 Depot Street Cafe next to the post office in nearby West Stockbridge village.

Bed was firm (which I liked, wife didn't).  Location very convenient to major attractions (Normal Rockwell Museum, Botanical Gardens, Tanglewood and summer mansion museums in Lenox) and to Mass Pike (light sleepers may hear traffic on Pike).

Owner asks when you'll be in the room and turns off heat when you're not to keep costs down.  Heat was always on at times we said we'd be in the room. Office could use repainting, but room cosmetics were OK.  Outdoor pool available in summer."
"We were in Stockbridge for my class reunion and needed an affordable place to sleep and change clothes. Pleasant Valley fit the bill perfectly. Close to the Norman Rockwell Museum, where we had a tour scheduled and close to Stockbridge without some of the high prices in the Stockbridge and Lee hotels."
"My father and I were passing thru and just needed a place to sleep for the night. The price was right - nothing fancy that's for sure. Note ""free breakfast"" is advertised but is just cornflakes milk juice and coffee - outside.  Again- I did not expect breakfast for the price and really just coffee should be given. The wifi worked well - a big plus for sure.  It was noisy with the sound of trucks on the highway and when the next door room showered at 4 AM the sound echoed thru the room. Still - considering the price I give 3 stars. "
"This motel  is  located immmediately off of Exit 1 of the Mass Turnpike. It is near many tourist spots: Norman Rockwell Museum, Chesterwood, Stockbridge Botanic Gardens, Namkege, Tanglewood,  Edna St Vincent Millay's home, etc. If you have a bike, all of these areas are easy to get to by bike.  The motel is in West Stockbridge and the center is a 1/4 mile from the motel. It has interesting stores and is a quintessential New England town."
"I have stayed there beginning over twenty years ago.  It was always just a comfortable place to stay and I liked being able to drive right up to the door to the room.  The motel rooms are clean albeit lacking in Rockwellesque decor.  It definitely needs an overhauling if it wants to get repeat guests..  It is too dark, sheets too thin and blankets that are worn out.

The reception area is a nightmare.  First, it is not inviting and I had read about an encounter with an employee answering the phone who did not understand English very well--I thought this was an exageration, but I actually was standing there when someone called regarding a reservation--I wanted to take the phone from the older woman and make the reservation myself.  This is not the way to run a business.

The outside had none of the hanging baskets that Vinny was so proud of all those years.

Honestly, I just think they don't know how to run a motel.

The performance at Tanglewood was wonderful.  It was just too bad the motel was not."
"Other reviews are not inaccurate, just unfair. We paid $55 plus tax. The room is fine. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is clean, stocked with enough clean towels, soap and shampoo. The AC worked great.  Free wifi and coffee. Happy to have stayed here. "
"My party of three stayed one night in this 1950s era motel while attending a concert at nearby Tanglewood Music Center (only about 5 miles away). This was very bare bones accommodations. We stayed in Room # 3. The bathroom was clean except for the old, very stained bath tub which we chose not to use.  The two double beds had springy, unsupportive mattresses but the bed linens and towels were clean. Room was quiet at night. Parking is conveniently at the front door.  Room had a refrigerator and flat screen TV. The continental breakfast was OK but nothing out of the ordinary. Staff were friendly.
Considering our stay was just to have a cheap place to sleep while visiting Tanglewood, our stay was tolerable but I would not recommend this motel unless you're on a very tight travel budget. My party would not stay here again.
My review applies only to Room # 3. Some of the other 16 total rooms, I understand, have been renovated and might provide better accommodations. If you do choose to stay here, ask for one of these rooms."
"Clean, comfortable, no frills room with new bath, nice TV and free Wi-Fi.

We enjoyed our coffee and corn flakes on the front porch with pretty hanging flowers and a priceless view of the mountain.

The family running the motel is doing a good job.  Thank you."
"We checked in for 2 nights yesterday and today.The room while not garnd was spotless and comfortable with flat screen tv and compact but well appointed bathroom , the room smelled fresh well airconditioned and with 2 twins. The modest breakfast with cerial was served on a quaint covered porch over looking the pool and a mountain beyond the well groomed grounds . The proprieter was gracious and his young family very pleasant. You feel welcome at this place , the only complaint was not having a week to spend there and the pain of leaving this idylic berkshire location.  James Murphy   ."
Ok for the price. People don't speak English much at front desk. Clean room and free minimal breakfast . convenient location for tanglewood. Rainy didn't use pool. Room phone table is sad shape. Outdated bedding and furniture but for $49 worth it to rest your head for one night.
"We have used this for 3 summers, each year coming 2 or 3 times.  We come mid-week and use a discount code, paying about $35 per night.  It would not win a beauty contest and we absolutely do NOT hear the noise from the road.  The owner is pleasant, the room is clean.  There is some sort of smell when you initially enter the room.  After a few minutes, we do not smell it.  Bed was more comfortable last year than this year.  Minimalistic toiletries.  However, we use it just for sleeping.  Too busy enjoying the theaters and museums.  You cannot beat the price.  And, by the way, our rooms have always been clean.  I would be the first to complain if they were not.  As soon as you get to the room, the owner phones to see if everything is ok."
"Pure 5 for $45 a night. Family run. Attentive. Even a nice self serve breakfast of OJ, Coffee, Cheerios, milk. Nice beds. Only downside is a bit of traffic on the nearby road. Be sure to park in front of your unit. Space for two cars. Provides two bars of soap; two shampoos; hair dryer; plentiful towels. "
"I was looking for an inexpensive, no-frills. motel, so I could get a shower and some sleep.  I had travelled 180 miles with another 100 in the morning.     i found the room to be clean and fresh smelling.  Just like the 60s, the TV and frig were unpluged.  Never needed the TV, but it was a flat screen and also unplugged.  No in room ammenities.  For the location and the price, I rate this pleasant place very good."
"First time I spent 5 days in room 11 and was quite satisfied (see review from 1 year ago).  This time I was with my husband, we were travelling and exhausted, and had a cat.  The room was awful. They charged $20 extra for the cat, which was fair, but once I saw the condition of the room, I was annoyed.  This was not like last year when I attended a retreat at Kripalu and needed a cheap, but nice room, and got it.  He was worried about damage from my cat, yet the molding was broken and hanging from the ceiling.  The mattress was a hard box.  Mold in the shower.  Water dripping hard in the shower.  Toilet set awkwardly on some kind of little platform.  Packets of shampoo, and not enough towels for 2 people.  The rug had not been vacuumed.  The top of the telephone table looked like it was picked up from a trash pile on the side of the road.  The top was warped, lumpy, peeling.  Really, I kept telling my husband, the room I had last year was so much better.  You get what you pay for, but this was a disgrace.  And really, they should get coffee pots for the rooms."
"It must be okay---we stayed 2 years ago and now again recently.  For the price you can not beat it.
It is clean, convenient, bed is good, has fridge and m/v, but no coffee maker.  However, coffee   was in the lobby just a few steps away from our room.  As others have mentioned, the room is dark, but if you're only there to sleep (as we were) it doesn't matter.  Wi-fi only worked for me right outside the lobby and not in the room.  Got good wi-fi reception at the coffee shop in the RR bldg in town, even when it was closed.  People there were so nice and gave me the password to use.  Am sure their coffee is good also, but didn't have a chance to buy some.  Anyway, PV Motel is exc. for what one pays---would use again."
"This hotel is managed by Indian family. They are very friendly and welcoming you.
One disappointment point is that the room smelled a sort of esthetic spices, and it was not bright. We had to open a curtain in the room even when it was afternoon.
Price is reasonable, however you should know what you deserve."
"This is a Mom-and-Pop motel, located in a scenic valley, as the name suggests. It does border the Mass Pike, as others have pointed out, but I didn't find the noise too bad. Closing the bathroom door does help.

Room 8 was mostly renovated, except door needed paint. Microwave and refrigerator seemed new. Reasonably clean, except heat and AC units were dirty. Bathroom small and odd-shape. Toilet small and uncomfortable. Bed was hard and not very comfortable, obviously an inexpensive mattress, but adequate.

Modest buffet breakfast (cold cereal, toast and bagels, coffee only, no tea) served, on week-ends only, outside on covered deck, presumably because there is no room indoors. I don't know what they do in the winter. 

Overall, a perfectly adequate ""budget"" choice. For the price I paid via Priceline, on Labor Day week-end, I can't complain."
"Our room with 2 double beds was around $54, and that includes tax. I've been traveling a lot recently, and it seems that all the hotel rooms were over a hundred dollars.  So this was a treat; the room was clean, and if it was a bit dated, who cares?   The TV, AC, lights, and internet connection all worked fine.  I would stay again."
"Stayed for 1 night when traveling to the Catskills for pumpkins and fall leaf peeping. Got the room for $89.00 on Expedia and it was definitely dated, but clean with plenty of hot water. Would stay again."
"This 1960s retro motel is ideal for a traveler looking for moderately priced lodging. Located on Route 295 next to the Tatonic Parkway the rooms are small but spotless. It is fine for the price. If it is only a bed to rest your head on for the evening this place is fine. No frills at all.
"
"The room was clean and provided the basics needed for a quick stop over.  The bed was comfortable and the view was nice. The check in was efficient and the person who checked us in was very helpful in providing assistance with dinner locations.  The rooms were as requested, one downstairs for my parents who have difficulty walking and one upstairs for us.  It is not a luxury hotel, but if you are using it as a place to stay while traveling, it does the job.  It is conveniently located off I-90."
